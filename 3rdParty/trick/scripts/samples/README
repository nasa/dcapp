Users can customize how dcapp is launched from Trick-based sims by creating customization files and including them in a
defined directory within the user's login directory.  This is the search order of directories in which the
start_dcapp.py script looks for these customization files:

    1. $HOME/.dcapp_$HOST
    2. $HOME/.dcapp

... where $HOME is the directory returned by the python "os.path.expanduser('~')" command and $HOST is the name returned
by the python "socket.gethostname()" command.

Note that this directory contains examples of such customization files that are set for various environments.  For
instance, if a user wants their machine to behave like the machines configured for the Capitol Hill demo in terms of how
dcapp is activated, they would copy or link config.py.HILLDEMO to their ~/.dcapp directory (or ~/.dcapp_$HOST directory)
and rename it to config.py.  For instance:

    cd ~/.dcapp
    ln -s $DCAPP_HOME/3rdParty/trick/scripts/samples/config.py.HILLDEMO config.py

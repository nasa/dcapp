User customization of Trick-based NExSyS sims is achieved by creating customization files and including them in a
defined directory within the user's login directory.  This is the search order of directories in which the
start_dcapp.py script looks for these customization files:

    1. $HOME/.nexsys_$HOST
    2. $HOME/.nexsys

... where $HOME is the directory returned by the python "os.path.expanduser('~')" command and $HOST is the name returned
by the python "socket.gethostname()" command.

Note that this directory contains several examples of such customization files that are set for various environments. 
For example, if a user wants their machine to behave like the machines configured for the Capitol Hill demo in terms of
how dcapp is activated, they would copy or link dcapp.py.HILLDEMO to their ~/.nexsys directory (or ~/.nexsys_$HOST
directory) and rename it to dcapp.py.  For instance:

    cd ~/.nexsys
    ln -s $DCAPP_HOME/3rdParty/trick/scripts/samples/dcapp.py.HILLDEMO dcapp.py
